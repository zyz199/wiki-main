title: 将 IIS 暴露在局域网内

import TH from "@site/src/components/TextHighlight/index";

My mac cannot access IIS server because of <TH>IIS server does not support running on macOS</TH>. And I want to use my mac to call the API on another Windows computer via LAN.

## Get IPv4 Address on Windows

We need to make sure our computers on the same LAN.

Open the cmd and type `ipconfig` to check your IPv4 Address.

```powershell
ipconfig
```

```powershell
IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.112
```

## Configure IISExpress

Check the file `applicationhost.config` and change the `bindingInformation`.

This file is located in the hidden directory `.vs/config`.

You can find the configuration file through the IIS Express icon in the bottom right corner.

```xml {7} title="applicationhost.config"
<site name="HMediaCore.Bff.MiniApp" id="9">
<application path="/" applicationPool="HMediaCore.Bff.MiniApp AppPool">
<virtualDirectory path="/" physicalPath="C:\repo\HMediaCore\src\HMediaCore.Bff.MiniApp" />
</application>
<bindings>
<binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="*:4738:localhost" />
<binding protocol="https" bindingInformation="*:44305:192.168.0.1" />
<!-- *:Port:IPv4 Address -->
</bindings>
</site>
```

Then open Visual Studio as <TH>administrator</TH>.

## Configure Firewall

Open the "Control Panel - System and Safe - Windows Defender Firewall". Then select advance settings and <TH>create a new inbound rule</TH>.

At last, we can access the API on the windows computer via LAN. It is a good way for the front-end developer to call the back-end local API.
