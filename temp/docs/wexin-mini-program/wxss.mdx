title: WXSS

import TH from "@site/src/components/TextHighlight/index";

## Dimension Unit

WXSS use "rpx" (responsive pixel) to adapt the screen width. It specified screen width is 750 rpx. We commonly use iPhone6 as the standard of visual view design.

Screen width on iPhone6 is 375px (750 physical pixels), then 750 rpx = 375 px = 750 physical pixels, i.e. 1 rpx = 0.5 px = 1 physical pixel.

:::caution
Always use `rpx` instead of using `px` or `rem`.

## Style Import

Use `@import` statement to import external style sheet. `@import` statement must followed by <TH>relative path</TH> and <TH>;</TH>.

```css title="WXSS"
@import "app.wxss";
```

## Inline Style

Always use `class` for static style and `style` for dynamic style.

Avoid using static style in `style`, it will affect the rendering speed.

```jsx title="WXML"
<view class="view" style="color: {{color}};"></view>
```

```css title="WXSS"
view {
  font-size: 20rpx;
}
```

:::caution
The style class names do not contain . and are separated with spaces.

## Global and Local Styles

A global style is defined in `app.wxss` and applies to every page, while a local one is defined in the page's `.wxss` and only applies to the current page (overrides the same selector in `app.wxss`).
